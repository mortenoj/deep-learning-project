Example: Team 1 always CT, Team 2 always T
From image: Type in map and CT or T side manually

array[const_size]:
map = "de_dust2" 
team1worth = 5000,
team1akcount = 3,
team1m4a4count = 1;
team1awpcount = 1,
team1uspscount = 4,
team1deaglecount = 1,
team1flashes = 5,

team2worth = 1000,
team2akcount = 3,
team2m4a4count = 1;
team2awpcount = 1,
team2uspscount = 4,
team2deaglecount = 1,
team2flashes = 5,
etc etc


Easiest example:

array[3]:
map = map,
team1worth = $$$$,
team2worth = $$$$
